# colors-lab
Colors lab project for Sam Trout in POOSD at UCF in 2026.

Is a website that allows for users to login and search for colors in the server database.
Users can also choose to add a color to the database.  There is no check that it's a real color, so it ends up just being a database of user submitted words.

The server is hosted on digital ocean using the LAMP API droplet.  It contains a mySQL database that can be accessed and edited through the php files in the api folder.  
The domain is through IONOS and was connected to the API server using putty.

To access the application all you need to do is go to the following link.

This will allow you to reach the application and see what is going on!  Thank you for checking out my project!
